For **every problem**, follow these instructions

## 1. Problem-Solving Methodology (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify which standard technique/algorithm this problem requires
- **Solution Path:** Build logical steps from problem statement to solution approach
- **Edge Case Analysis:** Consider boundary conditions before coding
- **Complexity Estimation:** Estimate time/space complexity before implementation

## 2. Environment & Automation Setup
- All Codeforces solutions must be written in Python using the **`pypy3.10`** executable and must leverage the predefined snippet templates [python.json](mdc:python.json) to scaffold algorithms quickly.
- All files must reside directly inside the top-level directory which you must always assume we are already in (do not create ANY subfolders or duplicate directories).
- Every solution file must begin with the 67-line template snippet defined in `template.py` (lines 1–67); include it verbatim before your problem-specific code.
- **AUTOMATION REQUIRED:** Use Competitive Companion + parsing scripts for automatic test case download
- Solutions must be optimized for PyPy's JIT compiler
- **Never use web search unless the user explicitly requests it in their message.**
- **Never use `sys.setrecursionlimit` (e.g., `sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)`)** as it will guarantee memory limit exceeded on Codeforces.

## 3. Code Quality Standards
- Use concise, human-like variable names (e.g., n, m, a, b, res, ans, etc.) for speed, as is common in competitive programming
- Optimize critical sections (inner loops, repeated operations)
- Follow template-driven approach for faster implementation
- Prefer **single-pass scans with early exit** whenever possible
- Minimise temporary Python objects (e.g. stream integers from `stdin.buffer.read().split()` directly; avoid building throw-away lists)
- **Do not include any comments in the solution code. Solution files must be completely free of comments.**

## 3a. PyPy-specific Performance Hints
- Each additional pass over an `n = 2·10⁵` array costs ≈40–60 ms in PyPy's interpreter **before** JIT kicks in.  If the algorithm can succeed in one backwards/forwards scan, do so.
- Hash-table probes dominate: two `set.__contains__` per element is fine; eight per element risks TLE.  Merge look-ups when possible.
- The JIT warms up per function.  A tight loop in a helper that's called once per test case will never be JIT-compiled if the case is small. Keep the hot loop in the main function for large-`n` problems.

## 4. Algorithm Documentation
- Briefly explain the algorithm and prove its correctness in ≤ 5 sentences
- **Must include:** Why this approach works and why alternatives won't

## 4a. Fast-Fail Checklist (add to every solution write-up)
  1. Is there any pass over the input that can be fused with another?
  2. Can membership tests be merged into one `set` instead of two?
  3. Is there an early return once the answer is known?
  4. Does the I/O layer avoid building large intermediate lists?

## 5. Complexity Analysis & Validation
- **Time Complexity:** O(?) with brief justification
- **Space Complexity:** O(?) with brief justification  
- **Constraint Check:** Verify solution works within time limits (typically 1-2 seconds)
- **Mathematical Proof:** Ensure the solution handles maximum constraints

## 6. Comprehensive Testing Protocol
- **Automated Sample Testing:** Use parsing tools to test against official samples automatically
- **Edge Case Testing:** Include ≥ 2 custom edge/boundary cases with documentation
- **Stress Testing:** Generate random test cases and compare with brute force solution when applicable
- **Execution:** Run all tests using `pypy3.10` immediately in the same response
- **Validation:** Show comprehensive test results table (✓/✗)
- **Separate Test File:** Store all testing logic in its own Python source (e.g., `test_<problem_id>.py`) placed alongside the solution; do not embed tests inside the main solution script.

### 6a. Test File Template
Always use this structure for test files:
```python
import subprocess
import sys
import time

def run_test_case(params...):
    # Calculate expected output
    # Logic to determine expected result based on test parameters
    
    # Prepare input
    test_input = f"1\n{param1} {param2} ... \n"
    
    # Run the solution
    process = subprocess.Popen(
        ["pypy3.10", "solution_file.py"], 
        stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
        text=True
    )
    
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate(test_input)
    
    # Check output
    actual = stdout.strip()  # Adjust parsing as needed
    
    if actual == expected:
        return True, f"PASSED: params..., output={actual}"
    else:
        return False, f"FAILED: params..., expected={expected}, got={actual}"

def run_all_tests():
    test_cases = [
        # Sample test cases from problem statement
        (param1, param2, ...),
        
        # Edge cases
        # Add minimum 2 edge cases with documentation
    ]
    
    results = []
    start_time = time.time()
    
    for params... in test_cases:
        success, message = run_test_case(params...)
        results.append((success, message))
    
    end_time = time.time()
    
    # Print results
    all_passed = all(success for success, _ in results)
    
    print("Test Results:")
    for success, message in results:
        print(f"{'✓' if success else '✗'} {message}")
    
    print(f"\nExecution time: {end_time - start_time:.4f} seconds")
    print(f"Overall: {'PASSED' if all_passed else 'FAILED'}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_all_tests()

## 7. Post-Solution Analysis
- **Alternative Approaches:** Briefly mention other possible solutions
- **Optimization Opportunities:** Identify potential improvements
- **Learning Notes:** Document new techniques or insights gained
