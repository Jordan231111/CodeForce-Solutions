For **every Codeforces problem**, follow these instructions

## 1. Problem-Solving Methodology (CRITICAL FIRST STEP)
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify which standard technique/algorithm this problem requires
- **Solution Path:** Build logical steps from problem statement to solution approach
- **Edge Case Analysis:** Consider boundary conditions before coding
- **Complexity Estimation:** Estimate time/space complexity before implementation

## 2. Environment & Automation Setup
- All Codeforces solutions should be written in **PyPy**, using the **`pypy3.10`** executable
- The working directory is always assumed to be the [CodeForce](mdc:cci:7:/file:/Users/jordan/Documents/CodeForce:0:0-0:0) directory
- **AUTOMATION REQUIRED:** Use Competitive Companion + parsing scripts for automatic test case download
- Solutions must be optimized for PyPy's JIT compiler

## 3. Code Quality Standards
- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- Optimize critical sections (inner loops, repeated operations)
- Follow template-driven approach for faster implementation
- Prefer **single-pass scans with early exit** whenever possible
- Minimise temporary Python objects (e.g. stream integers from
  `stdin.buffer.read().split()` directly; avoid building throw-away lists)

## 3a. PyPy-specific Performance Hints
- Each additional pass over an `n = 2·10⁵` array costs ≈40–60 ms in
  PyPy's interpreter **before** JIT kicks in.  If the algorithm can
  succeed in one backwards/forwards scan, do so.
- Hash-table probes dominate: two `set.__contains__` per element is fine;
  eight per element risks TLE.  Merge look-ups when possible.
- The JIT warms up per function.  A tight loop in a helper that's called
  once per test case will never be JIT-compiled if the case is small.
  Keep the hot loop in the main function for large-`n` problems.

## 4. Algorithm Documentation
- Briefly explain the algorithm and prove its correctness in ≤ 5 sentences
- **Must include:** Why this approach works and why alternatives won't

## 4a. Fast-Fail Checklist (add to every solution write-up)
  1. Is there any pass over the input that can be fused with another?
  2. Can membership tests be merged into one `set` instead of two?
  3. Is there an early return once the answer is known?
  4. Does the I/O layer avoid building large intermediate lists?

## 5. Complexity Analysis & Validation
- **Time Complexity:** O(?) with brief justification
- **Space Complexity:** O(?) with brief justification  
- **Constraint Check:** Verify solution works within time limits (typically 1-2 seconds)
- **Mathematical Proof:** Ensure the solution handles maximum constraints

## 6. Comprehensive Testing Protocol
- **Automated Sample Testing:** Use parsing tools to test against official samples automatically
- **Edge Case Testing:** Include ≥ 2 custom edge/boundary cases with documentation
- **Stress Testing:** Generate random test cases and compare with brute force solution when applicable
- **Execution:** Run all tests using `pypy3.10` immediately in the same response
- **Validation:** Show comprehensive test results table (✓/✗)
- **Separate Test File:** Store all testing logic in its own Python source (e.g., `test_<problem_id>.py`) placed alongside the solution; do not embed tests inside the main solution script.

## 7. Post-Solution Analysis
- **Alternative Approaches:** Briefly mention other possible solutions
- **Optimization Opportunities:** Identify potential improvements
- **Learning Notes:** Document new techniques or insights gained
