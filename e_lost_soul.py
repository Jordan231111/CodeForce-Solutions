Codeforces Round â€“ Problem E: Lost Soul

Quick explanation:
- We need to find the length of the longest common prefix that can be achieved
- For each position i, we have two options: either a[i] == b[i], or we can use
  a copy operation to make them equal
- Copy operations work by using a value from the same array at a position
  with different parity
- We also have the option to delete exactly one element

The solution works by considering two separate cases:
1. No deletion needed: Check for direct matches or consecutive equal values
2. Single deletion: Check if deleting an element makes a prefix matchable

Complexity:
- Time: O(n) - we scan the arrays linearly
- Space: O(n) - we store sets of seen values
