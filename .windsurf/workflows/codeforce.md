description: Strict Instructions For Any Codeforce Problems
---

All Codeforces solutions should be written in **PyPy**, using the **`pypy3.10`** executable.

* The working directory is always assumed to be the [CodeForce](cci:7://file:///Users/jordan/Documents/CodeForce:0:0-0:0) directory.  
* Solutions must be optimized for PyPyâ€™s JIT compiler.  
* For **every Codeforces problem**:
  1. Create a **test file** with **thorough test cases**, including edge cases.  
  2. **Immediately run** the tests using `pypy3.10` in the same response.
